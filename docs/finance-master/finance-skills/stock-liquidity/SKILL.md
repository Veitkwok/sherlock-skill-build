# Stock Liquidity · v4.6.6

## Consumer rules

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| bid, ask, last, volume | IBKR `get_price_snapshot` / pack |
| avg_90d_usd_volume | IBKR snapshot field |
| 52w context | `misc_statistics` |
| Historical volume profile | IBKR `get_price_history` if needed |

**Banned required path:** yfinance. Full-order-book L2 not available — say so.

## Analysis

1. Quoted spread $ and % of mid  
2. ADV USD vs intended notionals (if user gave size)  
3. Days to trade X% ADV heuristic  
4. Grade: **High / Medium / Low / Micro** liquidity  
5. Caution for wide spread + low ADV  

Detail ideas: `references/liquidity_reference.md` (ignore yfinance field names as required APIs; map to IBKR).

## L2 confidence (Cog-4 · advisory only)

`confidence` in `### RETURN_BLOCK` is **skill-local deliverable quality**, not user investment confidence.

| Rule | Max grade |
|------|-----------|
| `status: partial` or material `fields_gap` | **B** |
| X/social-only evidence for hard claims | **C** |
| `status: blocked` | no thesis A |
| Complete skill scope + hard sources + no material gaps | **A** allowed (still advisory) |

Default `confidence_scope` for this skill: **single_dim**.

Also emit Cog-4 fields when practical: `confidence_scope`, `confidence_basis` (evidence_independence, physical_mechanical, data_gaps_material), `limiting_factors`.

**Never** emit Brain `### CONFIDENCE_BLOCK` or `mode:` — the Central Brain re-grades via §H.6.
