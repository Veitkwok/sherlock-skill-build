# Method Library INDEX (Cog-3 · first 12)

**Authority:** Central Brain `sherlock-finance/SKILL.md` §M owns **when** to load.  
**Never** load this entire folder into context. Load **only** cards listed by §M for the current turn.

**Data plane (all cards):** IBKR MCP → Web → X. **Banned:** yfinance, longbridge, funda, AkShare, opencli readers.

## Mode gates (summary)

| mode_effective | Max cards / turn | Default |
|----------------|-----------------:|---------|
| **lite** | **0** | Off (clinical language already in §8.L) |
| **standard** | **0–3** | Only if trigger keywords match |
| **max** | **1–6** (cap 6 even if more match) | Intent-ranked from table below |

Token control: if tool budget nearly exhausted, **skip cards** and note `method_cards: skipped_budget` in SESSION_CACHE.

## Selection algorithm (Brain)

```
1. mode_effective == lite → load none
2. Collect cards whose triggers match user intent OR path (forensic/earnings/fraud/chain)
3. Rank: M05, M01, M03, M02, M09, M07, M10, M06, M08, M04, M12, M11
4. Truncate to mode max (std 3, max 6)
5. Emit METHOD_CARDS_LOADED: [ids]
6. Apply card ops inside §1 Steps 2–5; do not replace §D/§9
