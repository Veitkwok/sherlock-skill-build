# Startup Analysis · v4.6.6

## Consumer rules

- Web-only research (company site, news, funding databases via search).  
- **Do not** call quarantined `yc-reader` / opencli-reader.  
- If public US ticker exists, optional IBKR quote.  
- Frameworks: `references/vc-framework.md`, `job-applicant-framework.md`, `ceo-framework.md`.

## Three lenses (default all)

| Lens | Core questions |
|------|----------------|
| VC | Market, product, traction, team, defensibility, round terms |
| Job applicant | Runway, equity realism, growth, culture signals, role leverage |
| Founder/CEO | PMF, burn efficiency, org health, competitive pressure |

End with: aligned insights vs tensions across lenses. Research support only.

## L2 confidence (Cog-4 · advisory only)

`confidence` in `### RETURN_BLOCK` is **skill-local deliverable quality**, not user investment confidence.

| Rule | Max grade |
|------|-----------|
| `status: partial` or material `fields_gap` | **B** |
| X/social-only evidence for hard claims | **C** |
| `status: blocked` | no thesis A |
| Complete skill scope + hard sources + no material gaps | **A** allowed (still advisory) |

Default `confidence_scope` for this skill: **single_dim**.

Also emit Cog-4 fields when practical: `confidence_scope`, `confidence_basis` (evidence_independence, physical_mechanical, data_gaps_material), `limiting_factors`.

**Never** emit Brain `### CONFIDENCE_BLOCK` or `mode:` — the Central Brain re-grades via §H.6.
